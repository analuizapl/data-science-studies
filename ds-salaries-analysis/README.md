# Data Science Salaries Analysis

In this project I analyze salaries in the field of data science, providing insights into various roles, experience levels, employment types, and company sizes. The analysis includes data processing tasks and visualizations to better understand salary distributions and other key factors.

# Overview
The code in this project performs the following tasks:

* Loads a CSV file containing salary data

The CSV file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and the first 5 rows are displayed to give an initial look at the dataset.

* Cleans and preprocesses the data by dropping unnecessary columns and replacing categorical values

Unnecessary columns (Unnamed: 0, salary, salary_currency) are dropped to simplify the analysis. Data types and missing values are checked to ensure data integrity.

* Provides descriptive statistics and insights into the data

Descriptive statistics are provided for numerical columns, giving insights into the data distribution.

* Visualizes the data using various charts and graphs

Several visualizations are created to understand the data better:

* Histogram of salary distribution
* Box plot of salaries
* Pie chart of experience level distribution
* Bar chart of employment types
* Bar chart of job titles with the highest salaries
