## Customer Personality Analysis Clustering

# Overview

This project applies K-Means clustering to the Customer Personality Analysis dataset to group customers into distinct clusters based on their characteristics and behavior. The process includes data preprocessing, determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method, fitting the K-Means algorithm, evaluating the clustering quality, and visualizing the results.

# What is Clustering?

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters. It is commonly used for exploratory data analysis to identify natural groupings within a dataset. Each cluster represents a collection of data points that are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Clustering is widely used in various applications such as market segmentation, customer profiling, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.

# What is K-Means Clustering?

K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters. The algorithm works as follows:

+ Initialize: Randomly select K centroids (one for each cluster).
+ Assign: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
+ Update: Calculate the new centroids as the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster.
+ Repeat: Repeat the assign and update steps until the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

K-Means aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which measures the variance within each cluster.

# What is the Elbow Method?

The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering. It involves the following steps:

+ Run K-Means for a range of K values (e.g., from 1 to 10).
+ Calculate the WCSS for each K.
+ Plot the WCSS values against the number of clusters (K).
+ Look for an "elbow" point in the plot where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down significantly. The corresponding K value is considered the optimal number of clusters.
